# first-AI-workflow-using-n8n

I had a problem consistently posting on Linked-in, and I've always thought of a task to improve my hands on in AI automation, so I thought "why not automate this"

Task Accomplished
- First, I added a schdule trigger for every 7.00am and 8.00pm
- I added a model from openai
- With the right prompt, (in my jsoon file), I came up with the perfect prompt to feed the model, that fits my niche 
- Checked for the exact node I'll be needing to post on Linked-In ('Create a post' node)
- Coupled this to my workflow, and it worked perfectly
